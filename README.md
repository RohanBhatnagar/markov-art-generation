# Markov-Art-Generation: 
This experiment builds a Markov chain by analyzing the color transitions a set of input images. After the chain is created, the project produces images with statistically identical color transitions.

Given an original image or set of images, this project generates random images with familiar shapes/patterns. Below is an example. The original image is on the left, and the generated image is on the right. With a collection of images with the same color pallette, we can extract features and produce new artwork.<br/> <br/>
